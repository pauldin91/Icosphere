# Icosphere implementation
OpenGL v3.0 is used to render an Icosphere with selected number of face subdivisions
Geometry Shader is used to create an explosion-like effect in which the central face 
of each parent face subdivision is displaced disproportionally towards its outward normal vector


# Build & Run
Use `make all` and `./Source` to build and run the application respectively
and `make clean` to clean the binaries.

# Demo
For a short demonstration take a look at geodesic.mkv video
